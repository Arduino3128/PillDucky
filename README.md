# PillDucky
PillDucky is similar to "Hak5's Rubber Ducky" but for STM32 boards.  

## Introduction  
### Bootloader  
STM32 boards do not come with bootloader flashed out of the box. However, it is quite easy to burn bootloader.   
The recent [Bootloader 2.2.x](https://github.com/Serasidis/STM32_HID_Bootloader/releases/latest) enables STM32 to work as a HID.  
If you are not sure how to flash the bootloader to STM32 "Caleb Marting" have a great video on how to do just that.[Caleb Marting's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Myon8H111PQ) .
